I'm a Ph.D. student in Computing Science at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/) in Vancouver, Canada.

My research interests are in **Computer Vision**, **Machine Learning**, **Generative Models**, and **Reinforcement Learning**.

I focus on developing novel approaches for 3D representation learning, point-based rendering, and multimodal conditional image synthesis. My work combines theoretical insights with practical applications in computer vision and deep learning.

Before joining SFU, I completed my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering (Artificial Intelligence and Computer Networks) and Electrical Engineering (Control) at Amirkabir University of Technology in Tehran, Iran, where I ranked in the top 5% of my class.
